# Storefront Deployment

Welcome to Storefront Deployment repository. Here, you can found a Github Actions we produce to simplify deployments of Storefronts to the Console & Cloud.

There are four actions:

- build-middleware
- build-frontend
- reuse-middleware
- deploy

With those four you can easily compose the deployment script for your needs.
